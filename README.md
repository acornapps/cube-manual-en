# Cube Introduction

**Cube** allows for the easy installation of **Cocktail** on local testing environments, bare-metal servers, public clouds \(AWS, Azure, and GCE\) via a command-line interface. On Linux and Mac OS, you can test cluster environments via [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as the local testing environment.

**Cube** is comprised of cubetool and cube cli. Cubetool runs via Docker containers, and its roles include cube script downloading for cube cli, public cloud infrastructure creation, k8s installation, and Cocktail installation.
