# Cocktail Installation

## Preparations

The following programs must be installed before installing Cocktail. Otherwise, an error will occur.

1\) Download and install Docker \(Required\)

[https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)

2\) Download and install Vagrant \(If building a local testing environment using VirtualBox\)

[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

3\) Download VirtualBox \(5.1.x version\) \(If building a local testing environment using VirtualBox\)

4\) Create and add private & public SSH keys \(Required\)

* SSH keys are used to access server instances created via Cube.

* The SSH key paths are specified in the key path entry of the cube.yaml file. For more information, refer to the documentation for each installation environment.

* Refer to the below section for information on creating new keys. As with existing keys, the newly-generated keys must be specified in the cube.yaml file.

```
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/cloud/.ssh/id_rsa): /Desktop/cubetest/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/cloud/git/cubedeploy/virtualbox/5/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/cloud/git/cubedeploy/virtualbox/5/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:liTKyW/l3eU9+mBzyksL0AKpYXRsvsQ793nWJiUgJC0 cloud@Clouds-MacBook-Pro.local
The key's randomart image is:
